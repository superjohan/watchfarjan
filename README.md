# Armbandsurf√§rjan by Jumalauta, a demo for Apple Watch

[Watch the demo on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfFoSLEEXkM)

I'll try to release the demo as part of the Jumalauta Collection on the App Store, but I very much doubt that Apple will allow this on the store. Doesn't matter that much, the target audience isn't that big either way. :)

You can watch this demo in the Apple Watch simulator via Xcode, although the frame rate is abysmal for some reason.

The demo has been developed and tested on a Series 3 watch. It's really small on a Series 4 watch (at least in the simulator), but I don't have a Series 4 watch so I'm not that interested in getting it fixed. The view doesn't seem to be full screen for reasons unknown to me, since the view is set in the storyboard and its dimensions cannot be changed.

Released at Flashparty 2018.
